# Donut-Shop
This is a forecaster for a fictional set of donut shops. The table data is dynamically generated with JavaScript. This is an in progress side project.

Enhancement ideas:
1. Allow the user to add a new shop to display
2. Need to add in the inability to not have maxCust < minCust and vice vera
3. Can't have a negative or zero minCust, maxCust, perCust
4. All input fields will only allow numbers.
5. Input fields can't be blank
