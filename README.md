# Donut-Shop
This is a forecaster for a fictional set of donut shops. The table data is dynamically generated with JavaScript.

Enhancement ideas:
1. Allow the user to add a new shop to display
2. Need to add in the inability to not have maxCust < minCust and vice vera
3. Can't be open for more than 24 hrs
4. Find a way to consolidate functions for updating maxCust, minCust, perCust, and hrsOpen
